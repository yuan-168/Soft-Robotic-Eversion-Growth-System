# Soft-Robotic-Eversion-Growth-System
This project explores a **soft growing robot** that extends via eversion under internal pressure. The system integrates **computer vision**, **pressure sensing**, and **speed control** to analyze and control the robot's growth behavior.
## ðŸ§  Overview

The goal is to build and analyze a soft robot that grows by everting under pressure, using:
- **Camera-based tip tracking**
- **Speed & pressure control**
- **Data logging for analysis of growth dynamics**
